 * Check critical error:
 * When a composite with arguments was instantiated more than once, all the argument of the other instances
 * would get the same arguments value as the first.
 *
 * Explanation:
 * Old flatten algo replaced the argument key-value node in the definition by only
 * the value, losing "key" info when meeting the first one. All others instances arguments could thus
 * not be resolved (since no "key" was available anymore).
 * 
 * How to check:
 * 1/ Return value from Client.c
 * 2/ Opening the flattened result serialized in generated Level0_flat.adl:
 * With bug:
 * contains ServerArguments(INTVALUE = 0) as intermediateComp_l2_0_server;
 * contains ServerArguments(INTVALUE = 0) as intermediateComp_l2_1000_server;
 * After fix:
 * contains ServerArguments(INTVALUE = 0) as intermediateComp_l2_0_server;
 * contains ServerArguments(INTVALUE = 1000) as intermediateComp_l2_1000_server;
 *
